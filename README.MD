# Luggage Handling and Ticket Management System

## Project Overview

This project is a web-based application designed to handle ticket purchases, luggage registration, and management for a transportation service. The system allows customers to buy tickets, register their luggage, and receive a QR code that links to a detailed report of their trip. The system ensures that each trip is linked to a unique ticket number and supports multiple luggage items for each trip.

## Features

- **Customer Registration**: Allows customers to register their details even if they have already purchased a ticket in the past.
- **Ticket Generation**: Automatically generates a unique ticket number for each trip.
- **Trip Management**: Associates each trip with a ticket number and stores relevant trip details.
- **Luggage Registration**: Allows customers to register multiple bags and items for each trip.
- **QR Code Generation**: Generates a QR code that links to the detailed trip report, which customers can use for quick access.
